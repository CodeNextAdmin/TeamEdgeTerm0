 *  Team Edge Array Mini-project: THE SHOPPING LIST HELPER
 * 
 *  This project prompts users using readline_sync to prompt users
 *  to add (or remove) items from a shopping list. It starts empty
 *  and each time the program is run it asks you to either add or 
 *  remove an item from the list. It also updates the user of its
 *  contents. The shopping list also checks to see if an item 
 *  is already present in the array and prevents you from adding it
 *  again, giving feedback along the way. 
 *
